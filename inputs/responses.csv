"Timestamp","Example 1 demonstrates the process of drawing outlines around objects that are visible on an aerial imagery and assigning of respective labels. We hope that the example is clear (optional). 
","Example 2 presents an aerial image containing plastics, organic waste and other waste materials. In this image objects are very clear and a visual observer can easily draw outlines around objects of interest (i.e. plastics etc). We hope that the example is clear.","Example 3 presents is a blurred version of the image in example 1. With this quality of the imagery, a visual observer can find problems to draw outlines around objects of interest. For the purpose of this project, such images can make the task of quantifying the area of the waste pile that is covered by plastics to be difficult. We hope that the example is clear.","(1) Given a task to draw outlines around objects that are present in the picture below, would you be able to differentiate different objects and draw outlines?
